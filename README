Requirements:

The update of member statuses should run as frequently as is manageable, again getting a list of all members who have unsubscribed since yesterday and then syncing that data up.

Process 1:

Retrieve the newly added (since start of yesterday) records with a status of "active" from the oldsite.
Add retrieved records to the equivalent list on newsite.
If record already exists on the list on newsite, the record is not added again rather the record on newsite is updated.

Process 2:

Retrieve newly updated (since start of yesterday) records with a "status" of "trashed", "unsubscribed", "bounced", "trashedbyadmin" from the oldsite.
Update retrieved records to the newsite.
If record already exists on the newsite the status will be updated on the newsite.
If record does not exist on the newsite the record will be added to the newsite with the appropriate status

Process 3:

Retrieve newly updated (since start of yesterday) records with a "status" of "trashed", "unsubscribed", "bounced", "trashedbyadmin" from the newsite.
Add retrieved records to the oldsite.
If record already exists on the oldsite the status will be updated on the oldsite.
If record does not exist on the oldsite the record will be added to the oldsite with the appropriate status

Additionally there are these considerations:

* The oldsite <-> newsite list mappings will be kept / maintained in a config.ini type file.
* No admin interface is required, however informative messages / comments in the code will be of help.
* The script will be run from cron.
* Of key importance with this script is to default to the safest possible outcome for deliverability - where if in doubt then best to leave the member's record deactivated.
* Any updates to either newsite or oldsite member records will need to be logged in a text file on the server - one line per update detailing the list being updated and completed details.
